                    In the year 2020, amidst the abundance of free time brought upon by the Covid-19 pandemic, I found myself captivated by the world of computers. Initially, my days were filled with endless TikTok video marathons, but fate had something different in store for me. It was through the amusing mockery of the time-consuming updating process on TikTok that I discovered Linux, a powerful operating system.

                    Intrigued by what I saw, I decided to embark on a new adventure and delve into the realm of Linux. Armed with a USB drive and fueled by curiosity, I sought out the most user-friendly Linux distribution available for beginners. Little did I know that this simple act would ignite a lifelong passion within me.

I immersed myself in a world of possibilities, eagerly exploring every facet of this captivating field. As I delved deeper, I encountered a variety of integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Vim, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and many others, each offering its own unique set of tools and functionalities.
